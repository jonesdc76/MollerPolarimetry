The saturation magnetisation when plotted as a function of the total metalloid content shows an approximate trend in terms of charge transfer from the metalloid to iron atoms. The Curie temperature data show an approximate coincidence when plotted against X except for Fe-B-Al and Fe-B-Ge. This common curve follows semiquantitatively from results obtained here on the basis of the itinerant electron model. The relative change of volume dln V/dx was found to vary systematically with the effective valency of the added metalloid.}

  abstract={The paper gives an account of measurements made on the lattice parameter of cobalt when the material contained crystal grains of different sizes as found in fine dust, filings and annealed solid rod. The stable structure of cobalt was found to depend upon the grain size: between room temperature and about 450°c when the grain size is very small, as in cobalt sponge, the stable structure is face-centred cubic; when the grain size is larger, as in a solid rod, the stable structure is close-packed hexagonal; when there is a range of grain size, as in fine filings a mixture of these two structures is observed. At temperatures above 450°c cobalt sponge is still face-centred cubic, and the filings and rod also now show face-centred cubic structure with the same lattice parameter (3.5370kx at 18°c). The lattice constants of the hexagonal close-packed structure at 18°c are: a = 2.5003kx, c/a = 1.632 2 . Different results were obtained according as the material was maintained and examined at elevated temperature or was quenched from elevated temperature and examined at room temperature. All specimens of cobalt, whatever the grain size, annealed at about 1000°c and quenched showed a mixture of the two structures although with cobalt sponge the amount of the hexagonal structure was very small compared with the amount of the cubic structure. Combining these results with recent results by Newkirk and Geisler (1953) it is possible to present a fairly complete picture of the effects observed, between room temperature and 1220°c, with material examined at elevated temperature and with quenched material examined at room temperature. The main results fit the theory of the imperfect hexagonal structure put forward by Edwards and Lipson (1943). A cubic face-centred structure with lattice parameter (3.5540kx) greater than that of the cubic lattice ordinarily found (3.5370kx) was observed with filings quenched from temperatures between about 600°c and 840°c. It is suggested that the material giving this lattice parameter is in a metastable state. The thermal expansion of cobalt sponge is represented by a smooth curve the equation of which, for temperatures up to 650°c, is the quadratic a t = α 0 (1 + α t + β t 2 ), where a 0 = 3.5362 kx; α = 12.297 × 10 -6 ; β = 2.042 × 10 -9 . It shows no transformation such as is found at about 450°c with material in solid form. No other high-temperature transformation was observed.}
